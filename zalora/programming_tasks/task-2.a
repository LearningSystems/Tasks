I am tempted to define Database as collection of data, log files and other configuration files.

Schema as How is data is structured inside database , very crudely speaking It is blueprint of How data is constructed
    In relational database systems schema defines the tables, fields, views etc

Table is collection of related data together in which It has row and columns for relational database systems

View is result of query. It will be returning query object.
