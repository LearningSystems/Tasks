a ) I will be tempted to define DataBase systems as Collection of Data. That system contains logs , cofiguration along with data. 


	Schema as How is data is structured inside database , very crudely speaking It is blueprint of How data is constructed
    In relational database systems schema defines the tables, fields, views etc


	Table is collection of related data together in which It has row and columns for relational database systems


	View is result of query. It will be returning query object. View is virtual table contains data on run time. I may be different tables also. 


b )  Table comprises of row and columns comprising of row containing data or records. 
	
	View is virtual table that contains data on run time.  It is result of SQL Statement. 

	This data can be from different tables as you can JOIN results of different SQL statements to give one result. 


c ) 
	Table Name is reporting.items 
	Columns : Item_Code - Date - Visits - Orders

	SQL Statement as follows 
	1. SELECT SUM(Visits) AS TotalVisits FROM reporting.items WHERE Date = '2013-01-12';
